# Auto-Shopping-List
This project allows the user to add, delete, organize, and even view their current shopping list. I used the coding language Python for this project and it was done using the application Virtual Studio Code. This project is split up into 3 different functions which are combined to create the final script.

When you run this script, you will be prompted to choose a number between 1 and 8 that corresponds with a choice regarding what the user wants to do with their list. Be sure to only enter numbers between 1 and 8 or an error message will pop up and prompt you to enter a new number. After you choose an option, it will always prompt you to make another selection unless you choose to quit the program.

I worked on this project with Viri Camarillo
